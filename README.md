# Stargates SE

Based on [Klonan's teleporters](https://github.com/Klonan/Teleporters), this mod is designed specifically for Space Exploration. 

All Stargates are linked in one network, just like "real" Stargates.
Stargates have an energy buffer and require 1GJ of energy to fire. 

## Options

You can opt for Stargates to only be placed on Homeworlds, which is useful for situations where each faction starts on their own planet.
